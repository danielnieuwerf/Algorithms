- Dijkstra.cpp:

Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path.
- BiDirectedWeightedGraphNode.cpp:

A class of it's description. A collection of these objects forms the graph on which Dijkstra's algorithm can be implemented.
- SortingAlgortihms.cpp:

Some of my implementations of various sorting algorithms and the code used to collect data on these sorting algorithms.
- bubblesorts10000.png:

Bubble sort versus Bi Directional Bubble sort. 
- nlognsorts10000.png:

Three o(nlogn) algorithms were compared by collecting data on 5000 runs of sorting 10,000 random integers. We find that Binary Insertion sort is only slightly worse than heap sort and Intro sort is about twice as fast as heap sort.
